## Testing you tecnical skills
    - General programing concepts questions (verbal)

## Code test
    Our RV-Contact team needs to create a system where company users can be registered with the following data:

        - First name
        - Last name
        - Identification number
        - ID Type
        - Address
        - Phone number

    For them they must have an authentication system to be able to access the platform and be able to view other registered users who are registered.
    Where you can filter them by name, surname or identification number.

    They also requested that users be able to follow each other and be able to unfollow another user.

    Taking into account that the number of users of the company can reach more than 800 people, they request to be able to paginate users from 1 to 10 or 10 to 20.
